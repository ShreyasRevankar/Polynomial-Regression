### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Bias-Variance Trade off

When we discuss model prediction, it is important to understand the various prediction errors - bias and variance. There is a trade-off between a model’s ability to minimize bias and variance. A proper understanding of these errors would help in distinguishing a layman and an expert in Machine Learning. Be- fore using different classifiers, it is important to understand how to select a classifier to use.

Let us get started and understand some basic definitions that are relevant. For basic definitions when fˆ is applied to an unseen sample x refer [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff).

#### 1.2 Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm where the pre- dicted output is continuous and has a constant slope. 
It’s used to predict values within a continuous range, (e.g. sales, price) rather than trying to classify them into categories (e.g. cat, dog). 
There are two main types:
- Simple regression
- Multivariable regression
For a more detailed definition refer this [article](https://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/linear_regression.html).
